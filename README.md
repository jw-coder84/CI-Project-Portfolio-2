# User Experience (UX)

## Design Prototype
* The wireframe images below were created using Balsamiq Wireframes. The site layout was simple and contained so no changes were required for a table size screen. The layout only needed to change for mobile size screens.
* I ended up using one background image for the question and answer area.
* The end page was not implemented as I didn't have time but could be for a future feature.

## Site Structure
The site has a landing page with a 'play' button to initiate the quiz. The quiz content (questions, answers, buttons) appears in the center of the additional page.
